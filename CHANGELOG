This is the changelog for the Realnames extension.
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Realnames

=0.1.1 (2011-09-17)=
* eliminated use of create_function due speed implications (thanks [[User:Dantman]])
* changed user caching to realname cache for a smaller memory footprint (thanks [[User:Dantman]])
* moved debug handling into class and uses $wgRequest, can expand later for 1.18+ (thanks [[User:Dantman]])
* license change to BSD, cc is not recommended for software (says them) (thanks [[User:Dantman]])
* fixed author link (backported to 0.1, thanks [[User:Dantman]])
==Issues==
* It may be that this extension is slow on RecentChanges and History pages. If so, 
  I have a solution, but I'd rather not introduce more code if I don't have to. 
  If you experience noticable slowdowns on these pages please let me know at
