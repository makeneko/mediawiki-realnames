== 0.3 (2011-11-05) ==

features:
* you can opt-out of replacements using $wgRealnamesReplacements (thanks Salquint)
* we now have smarts in the form of not displaying "Marry - Marry" text
* you can change "smart" features like above using $wgRealnamesSmart

bugfix:
* version 0.2 misreported version as 0.1.1, now 0.3
* now tied into main debugging framework
* a missing return statement was causing titles in append style to get garbled

notes:
* switched to a more permissive and correct bsd-2-clause license agreement for commits
* added more metadata files

issues:
* I continue to be concerned with performance on large recentchanges/history since my initial
 post about it on 2011-09-19. After receiving a few code reviews recently (finally!) the main
 feedback has been that there may indeed be scalability problems with using newFromName. In my
 original post (see extension talk page) I proposed two solutions, but haven't heard from anyone
 experiencing problems yet. I think I may implement a two-pass as described in the next feature
 version, however it will make the code significantly more complex. I'll hold off on extending
 those two specific pages until it's confirmed a two-pass isn't enough.

testing:
* svn trunk 2011-11-05, 1.18.0beta1, 1.17.0, 1.16.5, 1.15.5
